# 9: Lexical Scanner Implementation (1)

2018/10/24

Today, I am going to implement the lexical scanner for StellarSQL. It would be a quite big engineering, so I could only do the part 1 today. I don't even know how many parts it would be, but I would do my best.

There is a standard for SQL by ISO, which is "ISO/IEC 9075". Moreover, every DBMS have their own SQL syntax. Those DBMS follow the standard and add the extension syntax. An extension is only for a certain DBMS which define and implement it, and would not work on another one.

The full list of keywords is too long and we usually do not use most of all. More syntax supported, more complicated a DBMS is. To keep StellarSQL simple, I use the [keywords list](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_keywords.asp) in W3C SQL Tutorial, which is a basic version.

![keywords list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18013815/47444318-ce665e80-d7e8-11e8-9197-f01d1fc3d300.png)

Basically, these keywords are enough for normal usage.

So, I define these keywords in file [src/sql/symbol.rs](https://github.com/tigercosmos/StellarSQL/tree/master/src/sql/symbol.rs).

!FILENAME src/sql/symbol.rs

```rust
struct Symbol {
    name: String,
    len: u32,
    token: Token,
    group: Group,
}

enum Group {
    Keyword,
    Function,
}

enum Token {
    Add,
    AddConstraint,
    Alter,
    AlterColumn,
    AlterTable,
    All,
    And,
    Any,
    As,
    Asc,
    Between,
    Case,
    Check,
    // ...
    // ...
    // ...
    SelectTop,
    Set,
    Table,
    Top,
    TruncateTable,
    Union,
    UnionAll,
    Unique,
    Update,
    Values,
    View,
    Where,
}
```

The `Symbol` structure stores information for tokens, which includes `name`, `token`, and `group`. For example, a Symbol of "CREATE" keyword is `Symbol{ name: "CREATE", token: Token::CREATE, group: Group::keyword }`.

`Token` stores all keywords of SQL that the scanner needs to know.

`Group` classify the symbol a keywords or a function.

I am studying the code of MySQL for more than 4 hours. That's why it looks like I don't write too much code. I will continue tomorrow.
