# 11: Lexical Scanner Implementation (3)

2018/10/26

I found a cool project -- [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb), which has more than 15k stars.

> TiDB is an open-source distributed scalable Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) database. It features infinite horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability. TiDB is MySQL compatible and serves as a one-stop data warehouse for both OLTP (Online Transactional Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) workloads. -- From Github

I found this project because an article [*"How TiDB SQL Parser implement (TiDB SQL Parser 的实现)"*](https://pingcap.com/blog-cn/tidb-source-code-reading-5/)(Written in Chinese). The article introduces the parser of TiDB, and it's quite helpful for me. The parser source code is at [pingcap/parser](https://github.com/pingcap/parser). I refer partly from `lexer.go`, which implement the scanner, and `misc.go`, which implements the token identifier with trie.

Let's see some snippets from `TiDB`:

!FILENAME pingcap/parser/lexer.go

```go
// Scanner implements the yyLexer interface.
type Scanner struct {
  r   reader
  buf bytes.Buffer

  errs         []error
  stmtStartPos int

  // For scanning such kind of comment: /*! MySQL-specific code */ or /*+ optimizer hint */
  specialComment specialCommentScanner

  sqlMode mysql.SQLMode
}
```

!FILENAME pingcap/parser/misc.go

```go
func (s *Scanner) isTokenIdentifier(lit string, offset int) int {
  // An identifier before or after '.' means it is part of a qualified identifier.
  // We do not parse it as keyword.
  if s.r.peek() == '.' {
    return 0
  }
  if offset > 0 && s.r.s[offset-1] == '.' {
    return 0
  }
  buf := &s.buf
  buf.Reset()
  buf.Grow(len(lit))
  data := buf.Bytes()[:len(lit)]
  for i := 0; i < len(lit); i++ {
    if lit[i] >= 'a' && lit[i] <= 'z' {
      data[i] = lit[i] + 'A' - 'a'
    } else {
      data[i] = lit[i]
    }
  }

  checkBtFuncToken, tokenStr := false, string(data)
  if s.r.peek() == '(' {
    checkBtFuncToken = true
  } else if s.sqlMode.HasIgnoreSpaceMode() {
    s.skipWhitespace()
    if s.r.peek() == '(' {
      checkBtFuncToken = true
    }
  }
  if checkBtFuncToken {
    if tok := btFuncTokenMap[tokenStr]; tok != 0 {
      return tok
    }
  }
  tok := tokenMap[tokenStr]
  return tok
}
```

It is interesting and enlightening to read these code, but not just copy-and-parse. `TiDB` use `Yacc` to find the hierarchical structure of the program. The `Scanner` structure is following the interface of `Yacc`. However, I would implement all by myself without any other tools.

I spend too much time reading `TiDB` source code, so I just program a little bit today. I think it's fine that I show the code tomorrow, and it would be more complete.
