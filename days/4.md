# 4: Client/Server Communication Implementation(1)

2018/10/19

Before today's article, let's recall what I wrote in these days.

First, you should know DBMS is based on servers. A well designed DBMS such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, would implement very underlying layers by themselves for high quality and well performance. As I said before, I will focus on database and SQL, so I just use `Tokio.rs` for handling server tasks, including task scheduler, thread, I/O, etc. Of course, it would be great if I have time implement these modules in my own way in the future.

Then, I talked about client/server protocol yesterday, and I will implement the remaining part today.

A message would probably includes header, metadata, and payload. A header is about information of connection. A metadata is the description of payload. A payload is the part of transmitted data that is the actual intended message.

A message will be encoded according to the protocol. The protocol is the format of message. I will just implement message transmission in raw bytes first, and leave the part of the protocol, because the definition of protocol is much more complicated.

> about the implementation, please see day 6 article.
