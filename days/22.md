# 22: Update Components of Database

2018/11/6

I modify some parts that I did yesterday.

`Table` in `Database` should be stored in `HashMap`. So checking the table is convenient.

!FILENAME component/database.rs

```rust
pub struct Database {
    pub name: String,
    pub tables: HashMap<String, Table>,
}
```

I decide to store all value in `String`. For the reasons that, (1) the `Field` has defined the `DataType`, so we can format the value if we want, (2) DBMS will not use the real value so frequently (only when processing `where`, but that's fine to deal in `String`), and (3) loading and saving data are all in `String` (actually, string to binary).

Therefore I only remain `DataType`:

!FILENAME component/datatype.rs

```rust
pub enum DataType {
    Char(u8),
    Double,
    Float,
    Int,
    Varchar(u8),
}
```

Also, I forget that attributes could have default values. So I add a `default` in `Field`. Also, I remove `DataValue`, because `Field` is only the definition of a table. Therefore I also update table.

!FILENAME component/field.rs

```rust
pub struct Field {
    pub name: String,
    pub datatype: DataType,
    pub not_null: bool,
    pub default: Option<String>,
    pub check: Checker,
}
```

I also update `Table` a lot. A `Table` should be able to store `rows`, and it might be just a part of data from a huge set of table files. So, it needs to know where is the data from, including which `page` and which range by the `cursors`.

!FILENAME component/table.rs

```rust
pub struct Table {
    /* definition */
    pub name: String,
    pub fields: HashMap<String, Field>, // aka attributes
    pub primary_key: Vec<String>,
    pub foreign_key: Vec<String>,
    pub reference_table: Option<String>,

    /* value */
    pub rows: Vec<Row>,

    /* storage */
    pub page: u64, // which page of this table
    pub cursors: (u64, u64), // cursors of range in a page
}
```

I cannot design very well at the moment, so I would find more that should be modified as time goes by. In real practice, I believe I am on the right way.
