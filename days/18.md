# 18: Parser Implementation (2)

2018/11/2

Working on the parser. When I write the following function `Parser::new`, I encounter lifetime issue. No matter how I add lifetime syntax `'a`, '`b` in the function. I cannot pass the compiler.

!FILENAME sql/parser.rs

```rust
// The old version
struct Parser<'a> {
    tokens: Vec<Symbol<'a>>,
}

impl<'a> Parser<'a> {
    fn new(message: &'a str) -> Parser<'a> {
        let mut s: Scanner<'a> =  Scanner::new(message);
        let tokens = s.scan_tokens();
        Parser { tokens }
    }
}
```

The error is:

```log
error[E0597]: `s` does not live long enough
  --> src/sql/parser.rs:12:39
   |
12 |         let tokens = s.scan_tokens();
   |                      ^ borrowed value does not live long enough
...
15 |     }
   |     - borrowed value only lives until here
   |
```

That's very wierd, because I expect the lifetime is correct. Anyway, I give up fighting with lifetime.

Therefore, I change the type of `Symbol::name` to `String` rather than `&str`. Then all errors exist, and I don't need to add lifetime syntax anymore.

!FILENAME sql/parser.rs

```rust
use sql::lexer::Scanner;
use sql::symbol::Symbol;

struct Parser {
    tokens: Vec<Symbol>,
}

impl Parser {
    fn new(message: &str) -> Parser {
        let mut s: Scanner = Scanner::new(message);
        let tokens: Vec<Symbol> = s.scan_tokens();
        Parser { tokens }
    }
}
```

It works very well.

This story tells us, when you implement a `struct` in Rust, it is better to let the type `String` in the fields. Though it will be stored at heap, but it will be easier with lifetime handling -- once using `&str` as type, you must add `'a` lifetime for the `struct`, and all other `fn` or `struct` that use this `struct`. Also, all objects related to this `struct` in lifetime `'a`, will all live as long as `'a`, and it seems not a good idea. So, `String` next time.
