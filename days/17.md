# 17: Parser Implementation (1)

2018/11/1

I have done the lexical scanner. So, now I can get tokens from a message (SQL command).

The parser should do several things, including syntax checking, semantics checking and worker.

The syntax of a language is a set of rules that describes the words to make meaningful statements.

For example, a SQL query:

```sql
select from table t1
```

This is a wrong syntax. As you can see, there is no identifier in the middle of `select` and `from`. Also, `table` is not a keyword.

So, the correct one should be:

```sql
select user_id from table_t1
```

That's what syntax checking doing -- Find the wrong usage of SQL.

The semantics of a language specifies a statement to have an actual meaning.

For instance,

```sql
select user_id from table_t1
```

However, is `user_id` a field name? or is `table_t1` the name of tables? Is the name ambiguous? Is the type of field correct?

The semantics should check for these things.

Finally, if everything okay? The parser will pass the result to worker, and the worker will execute the tasks to finish the command.
