# Let's build a DBMS: StellarSQL -- a minimal SQL DBMS written in Rust

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tigercosmos/lets-build-dbms.svg?branch=master)

## Introduce

Database management systems (DBMS) are used in everywhere. There are many DBMSs, including MySQL, MongoDB, etc. I would implement a minimal DBMS supporting SQL in Rust, with a new project, "[StellarSQL](https://github.com/tigercosmos/StellarSQL)", from scratch. I will work on it everyday since 2018/10/15, and record the process in this series articles, until I finish StellarSQL.
